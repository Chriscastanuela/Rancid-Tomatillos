<ul>
    <li>Caleb - My favorite part of this project was finally figuring out 'data down actions up.' It felt like the moment that I figured out the preservation of the 'data model' in mod1. Jk the real best part of this project was hanging out with Chris again
    <li>Chris - It felt great to get more familiar with React, I feel like if I could do this project over again knowing what I know now it would be even better.
